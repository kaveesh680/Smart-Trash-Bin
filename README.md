# Smart-Trash-Bin

Reward system based smart trash bin for plastic bottles which helps people economically and at the same time reduce the environment pollution caused by the plastic wastes.

## Description

Users/Customers can dispose used plastic bottles to this smart trash bin and they will be rewarded by some points which they can use them later for many cases. There is a website that users/customers needs to register before disposing bottles to trashbin. All the disposing details will be recorded in a database which users can view them throgh their registered account.

This project is an IOT based project. Now I'll go through the techinilogies I used.

  ### Web Application
  
  ***Front-End***
  - React with typescript - Most familiar javascript framework
  - Redux and Local storage - To manage complex states
  - Apollo Client with GraphQL - To fetch data from the database
  
  ***Back-End***
  - MongoDb with mongoose - No SQL database
  - GraphQL - GraphQL API instead of REST API
  - JWT Web Tolken - User Authentication
  - Apollo Server - Complex state and cache management for both the frontend and the backend
  - Nodejs with Express
  
I herewith attached a link for the wireframes I created for the websites. But later I did some changes when developing the websites.
